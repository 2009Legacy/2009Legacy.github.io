# 2009 RSPS website

This is a clone of the project 2009scape. I was the official website developer for them and majority of the site was my volunteered work. I no longer liked the direction that the community was going and decided to go off on my own. As an open source project this is completely fine since again following the license agreement by showing anything that was written to the public. 

This website is a different copy than the official one for 2009scape. The history behind it is I used to write my own on website wiki but we at the time decided to create a wiki where anyone was able to edit it easily so this one was removed. Obviously, I wasn't about to give up on that work of all the page I had added so I saved an older copy without constantly updating it.



If you would like to use the website obviously you can since it's open source. 
Note: This exact copy of the website is not the official one. You are able to find the official one here : https://github.com/2009scape/2009Scape.github.io
Note: This is a haphazard hack of a 2009 website made by [jarryd229](https://github.com/jarryd229) combined with a 2010 website dump.
