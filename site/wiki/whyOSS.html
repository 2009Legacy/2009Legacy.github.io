            <b>Before we begin, lets get some of the Jargon out of the way so you understand me!</b>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1%;">
            A Desktop Environment aka DE, is a bundle of components that provide you common graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as icons, toolbars, 
            wallpapers, and desktop widgets. KDE, the one that I mentioned is one of the most customizable out of the box, while a DE like Patheon is very restrictive 
            without you doing some major overiding. You can make your PC look like a MAC, Windows, JARVIS, or anything your heart desires. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A Distribution aka Distro, is a OS itself. There are plenty of branches from the big ones Like Arch, Debian and Fedora. I normally recommend Linux Mint 
            for Windows Users switching over, and Elementary OS for those Proprietary Unix Users ( MAC ).
            <br>
            <br>
            Wine is  a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on OS like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac.
            <br>
            <br>

            Proton is Steam's version of Wine to allow you to run Windows games on steam.

            <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">Privacy!</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> I am a business owner, I do my own bookkeeping and I am a simple girl - I use spreadsheets. Back in 2019, 
                I was a Windows user that used Microsoft Excel. Excel was working well to keep all my financial information. I then wanted to book a flight and noticed that the 
                cost of plane tickets seemed a bit high. I asked my friend about it and looked up the same flight only to realize that on my PC, flights were showing 
                for $1000.00 more than my friend's PC. Realizing the more I looked, that Excel was to blame, since they were selling my financial information. 
                
                When I first moved to Linux, I wanted to make a new website. So, I started my website by creating an index.php file. I didn't understand why it didn't 
                just "work". Little did I know that PHP files require a server to be running. Ceikry brought this to my attention by making the valid point that Windows 
                has servers constantly running in the background.</p>

                <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">Creative Freedom!</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> Unlike Windows, your PC on Linux can look how you want. Yes, sometimes it requires extra tinkering, but with a DE, like <a style="color: greenyellow" href="https://kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KDE</a><img src="../2009scape-resources/tux/konqui.gif" height="30" width="30">, 
                you have tons of out-of-the-box customization.</p>
            
                <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">No Forced Updates</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> Though you will want to update your software in order to have the latest features and safety, 
                you also have the choice not to update at all. On some distros, you are unable to without your system acting funky like Manjaro. 
                For some updates you will need to restart in order for them to take effect, but you do not have to restart your PC in order to install the updates, 
                at least. It won't randomly shut down on you either.</p>
            
            <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">A Myth about Linux</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> Sure, there are some games that simply won't work and this is due solely to the developer not wanting to make them 
                compatible. You are free to choose your opinions on this; however, I think it's wrong to judge Linux based on such a few games that don't work. Steam uses their 
                own version of Wine called Proton, which allows you to play Windows games on Linux. Who would've thunk. Extra software like <a style="color: orange;" 
                href="https://lutris.net">Lutris</a> has made gaming on Linux super easy, from your possible favorite studio launchers like Ubisoft, CAPCOM, 
                Sony Interactive Entertainment, to even being able to throw a CD in there and install it 
                through that. </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;">You do not need to be a super user in order to use Linux. Linux is arguably easier to install than Windows. 
                It has a super user-friendly interface that allows you to click a couple of buttons and bam you're all set up! You could argue that the older Linux 
                years were rough, but that is nothing like how it is today.</p>
