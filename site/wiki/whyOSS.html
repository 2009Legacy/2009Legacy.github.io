            <b>Before we begin lets get some of the Jargon out of the way so you understand me!</b>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1%;">
            A Desktop Environment aka DE, is a bundle of components that provide you common graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as icons, toolbars, 
            wallpapers, and desktop widgets. KDE, the one I mentioned is one of the most customizable out of the box while a DE like Patheon is very restrictive 
            without you doing some overriding. You can make your PC look like a MAC, Windows, JARVIS, or anything really. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A Distrobution aka Distro, is a OS itself. There are plenty of branches from the big ones Like Arch, Debian and Fedora.
            <br>
            <br>
            Wine is  a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on OS like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, and Macs.
            <br>
            <br>

            Proton is Steam's version of Wine to allow you to run Windows games on steam.

            <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">Privacy!</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> I am a business Owner, I do my own bookeeping and I am a simple girl. I use spreadsheets. In 2019, I was a Windows User that used
                Microsoft Excel. Excel was working great for keeping all my finacial information. I then wanted to book a flight and noticed that costs of plane
                tickets seemed a bit high. I asked my friend about it and looked up the same flight only to realize that on my PC, flights were showing for a $1000.00 
                more than my friend's pc. Realizing the more I looked that Excel was to blame since they were selling my financial information. 
                
                When I first moved to Linux, I wanted to make a new website. So, I started my website with creating an index.php file. 
                I didn't understand why it didn't just "work" Little did I know, PHP files require a server to be running. Ceikry brought this to my attention by 
                making a valid point that Windows has Servers constantly running in the background.</p>

                <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">Creative Freedom!</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> Unlike Windows, your PC on Linux can look how you want. Yes, sometimes it requires extra tinkering but with a DE, like <a style="color: greenyellow" href="https://kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KDE</a><img src="../2009scape-resources/tux/konqui.gif" height="30" width="30">, 
                you have tons of customization out of the box.</p>
            
                <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">No Forced Updates</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> Though you will want to update your software in order to have the latest features and safety, you also have the choice to not update at all. On some distros you are unable to without your system acting funky like Manjaro.
            For some updates you will need to restart in order for them to take effect but you do not have to restart your PC in order to install the updates at least. It won't randomly shut down on you either.</p>
            
            <b style="font-size: 16px; text-decoration:underline;">A Myth about Linux</b>
          
            <p style="margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%;"> There is no way to game on Linux:

                Sure, there are some games that simply won't work and this is solely due to the developer not wanting to. You are free to choose your opinions on this; however, I think it's wrong to judge Linux based on such few games that don't work. Steam uses their own version of Wine called Proton which allows you to play Windows games on Linux. Who would've thunk. 
                
                Extra software like <a style="color: orange;" href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lutris</a> has made gaming on Linux super easy from your possible favorite studio launchers like Ubisoft, etc ( idk AAA companies that well ) to even being able to throw a CD in there and install through that.</p>
